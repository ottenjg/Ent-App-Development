# Ent-App-Development
Final project for IT4050C
## Introduction

Welcome to Character Creator! This application is a spot to create a D&D style character with some assistance. Everything will be randomized if you choose. 
We will have the ability to create stats with our very own 20 sided die functionality. We have the ability to save characters with an account, so you can save and return at any time! You will also be able to view other characters from the community. 
This tool will be a helpful tool for quickly making NPC characters for a campaign or even getting started with your own character to play as during a campaign.

## Functional Requirements
As a User<br>
• I want to create a character for D&D without having to roll dice for attributes <br>
• So that I can get into a quick game without spending a lot of time determining stats <br>
• Given a character name and a character background <br>
• When entered into the form and the attributes are calculated <br>
• Then the form allows you to print the character sheet <br>
• Given no character name or background <br>
• When the form is filled out <br>
• Then throw a user error saying that it needs a name and background to be able to print <br>
As a User <br>
• I want to click in one of the attributes and have it calculate a value based on the D&D ruleset <br>
• So that the attribute value is random, and I don’t have to use dice to calculate <br>
• Given a place to click to interact with <br>
• When each attribute is selected <br>
• Then it uses a random number generator to calculate two numbers from 1 to 20 twice and taking the higher of the two values <br>
As a User <br>
• I want to be able to save the character sheet tied to a login <br>
• So that I can go back to this character sheet in the future and reprint if I want <br>
• Given the ability to login <br>
• When I log in <br>
• Then it gives me the ability to save <br>
